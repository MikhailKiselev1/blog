# Blog


### Краткое описание:

The user has a blog page where they can add new blog posts. Each authenticated user can comment on posts made by other users. The home page is a list of all posts broken down and sorted by 4 parameters (newest, most talked about, best, oldest). Unauthenticated users can create backgrounds for all blog posts, but not expand, like and dislike, add new posts or comments.
